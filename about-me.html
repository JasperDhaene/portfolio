                    <p>
                        I started out as a full-stack developer in a customer support team. 
                        Being in such close contact with users was immensely helpful to develop an empathy for user needs and it taught me a lot about improving customer satisfaction. 
                        After mentoring new developers and first-line support, I moved on to a full-time feature development team. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm very curious about how the product I'm developing works and I'm constantly thinking about holistic improvements. 
                        I specialised in maintaining a high standard of UI/UX across the engineering team through functional testing and code reviews.
                        By working in startups I've gained experience in developing features from start to finish.
                        With an eye for detail, I champion customer needs and help out wherever I can.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        Besides creating easy to understand tools for customers, I believe the next best thing you can do is allowing them to help themselves through great documentation. 
                        I have experience in technical writing, ranging from managing the documentation of new releases, to rewriting (and redesigning) an entire customer-facing knowledge base. 
                        I also love helping out colleagues outside the engineering team through my writing as well. 
                        I've created internal guides and feature explainers for non-technical teams in an approachable way. 
                        I've also written blog posts and made product videos for marketing purposes.
